SCALEX-mp
==============================

SCALEX is a Variational Autoencoder for the integration of single cell data from different batches.
It was originally designed for single cell sequencing data. SCALEX-mp is an adaption
for morphological (image-based) profiles. This implementation is based on
Pytorch Lightning and Weights and Biases for logging.

The main difference to the published SCALEX model is that the last decoder layer uses 
an identity transform as activation, because in contrast to count data morphological 
profiles are expected to be gaussian distributed.
Mean squared error is therefore used for the reconstruction loss. 

All hyperparameters can be individually adapted, including the size and number of
hidden layers. The reconstruction loss can also be changed to binary cross entropy as it 
is used in the original paper. Instead of the KLD-Loss in the regularization term the 
Maximum Mean Discrepancy can also be used to get a MMD-VAE.

## Usage

### ðŸ’¾ Logging

All experiments can be logged with Weights and Biases.
Log in with your credentials before training.

```
wandb login
```

### ðŸš© Main functions

```
import anndata as ad
from scalex_mp import SCALEXLogic
```
Load the AnnData object with morphological profiles (typically normally distributed)
and initialize the SCALEX procedure.
The default parameters are set to the parameters from the original publication (see references).
```
adata = ad.read_h5ad('your_file.h5ad')

logic = SCALEXLogic(
    adata=adata,
    batch_key='batch',              # name of observation
    latent_dim=10,                  # number of dimensions of the latent space
    encoder_layer_dims=[1024],      # dimensions of the hidden layers in the encoder
    decoder_layer_dims=[],          # dimensions of the hidden layers in the decoder
    beta=0.5,                       # coefficient of the KLD loss
    beta_norm=False,                # normalization of the beta coefficient
    regul_loss='kld',               # regularization loss: either 'kld' or 'mmd'
    recon_loss='mse',               # reconstruction loss: either 'mse' or 'bce'
    dropout=None,                   # dropout rate
    l2=5e-4,                        # l2 regularization
    batch_size=64,                  # batch size for training
    num_workers=4,                  # number of workers for training
    learning_rate=2e-4,             # learning rate for training
    optimizer="Adam",               # `Adam` or `AdamW` optimizer
)
```

Start training.
```
logic.fit(max_epochs=20, wandb_log=True)
```
Load a pretrained model.
```
model_path = "./checkpoints/last_model.ckpt"
logic = SCALEXLogic.from_checkpoint(model_path, adata=adata)
```
Load the latent features into your AnnData object.
```
adata = logic.get_latent()
```

### Command Line Interface

There are two scripts that can be used from the command line.
`trainSCALEX` takes an AnnData object and trains a model. The training can be logged with 
Weights and Biases. `projectSCALEX` takes a pretrained model from a checkpoint file and
an AnnData object to project the data onto the latent space.
